# The concept

## What are plugins?

ChartKit uses ready-made solutions for rendering visualizations, combining them with a single interface. In terms of ChartKit, such solutions are called plugins. The code describing the plugins is located outside the index file in order to be delivered to the end user only at the time of mounting the ChartKit component.

## Types of plugins

There are two types of plugins:

- [Built-in plugins](../category/built-in) that come with ChartKit
- [External plugins](./external), which users can describe from their side and connect in their code
